4. How does Big O of list access using elt(index) compare with array access?
	Arrays will have a lower big O, because each value within an array is indexed. There is no need to loop through the entire array in order to find a value at the end. I would guess that the Big O of array access is 1, while the array access of elt depends on the position of the item, varying between 1 and n.

5. What is the shape of the curve?
	Just like the one on the homework page. If it were curved, it would look like a normal curve.
